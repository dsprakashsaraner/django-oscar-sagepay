Welcome to SagePay payment gateway package for django-oscar's documentation!
============================================================================

This package provides integration between ``django-oscar 0.6`` or above and `SagePay Direct`_ payment gateway.

This project is a work in progress and still in development.

A direct integration enables you to collect your customers' payment information
on your own secure servers and securely pass card details across to SagePay to carry
out authorisation and store them safely. This means that you can completely tailor the
payment process to suit your business requirements.

.. Note::

    To use SagePay Direct method you will need a 128-bit SSL certificate to secure your payment pages.

.. Note::

    There is currently no support for form or server integrations.

.. _`SagePay Direct`: http://www.sagepay.com
